Overview
The project includes the following components:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load a dataset and prepare it for training.
Model Training: Train a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and display feature importances.
Image Visualization: Display images related to the space weather data.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Pillow
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib pillow
Usage
Prepare Your Dataset

Make sure you have a dataset named space_weather_data.csv with the following columns:

solar_wind_speed
proton_density
magnetic_field_strength
event_occurred (label)
Run the Script

Execute the script to train the model and visualize the results:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Review the Outputs

Model Performance: The script will output the accuracy and a classification report of the model.
Feature Importances: It will also print the importance of each feature used by the model.
Image Visualizations: The script will display images related to space weather (replace image paths as needed).
Script Details
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn is used.
Evaluation: Model accuracy and classification report are printed.
Feature Importance: Displays the importance of each feature.
Image Visualization: Uses matplotlib and Pillow to display images.
Images
mag.png - Replace with your image file related to magnetic field strength.
solar.png - Replace with your image file related to solar wind speed.
proton.png - Replace with your image file related to proton density.
